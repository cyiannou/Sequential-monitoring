# Sequential-monitoring
Short course notes for sequential monitoring of clinical trials
PDF files are the slides. These are created by an interface between R Markdown (see below) and the tex beamer package
Animations are done through the tex animate package
RMD files are R Markdown files. They can be compiled along with the GSM-header.tex to produce the slides files. 
Compilation the first time this is attempted takes a long time, as some animations produce a large number of files; be patient.
However, after the initial compilation, this is accelerated enormously, as the produced animation files are cached in the computer.
You can just use the code presented in the RMD file separately to create much of the figures and analysis results.
